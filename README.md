## TODO

* Launch on all google search urls (menifest.json)
* Adjust button's CSS
* Detect if current search language is set
* Better looking option
* Button on google search home page too
* Reload button when preference changed
* Grab the color of original bottoms instead of detect system setting

* Interchangable order
